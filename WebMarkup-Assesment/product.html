					<p>
						IoT is driving the development of wearable devices in the healthcare industry,
						now known as the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), where medical devices
						and applications are connected to healthcare IT systems. 
						The Internet of Things for medical devices involves machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
						 and connectivity to cloud platforms where data generated by devices is collected, stored, and analyzed.

						<h3 >3 How to use wearable technologies</h3>
					</header>
					
					<p>
						AI wearables can support fitness in everyday training activities.
				        Most fitness wearables help users track their activity. When the 
				        user walks her 12000 steps, the wearable device counts and displays 
			            the steps. However, the limitation of these wearables is that at some 
			            point people will not understand how their data is used. In addition
		                to tracking data, AI-enabled wearables can define things like what 
	            	    users need to eat, how much they need to sleep, and how they need
	            		to exercise to improve their fitness. increase.

						<h3 > 6 What Does the Future Hold for Wearable Technology?</h3>
					</header>
					
					<P class="art-P">
						The future of wearable technology has successes and failures.
						It's also safe to say that wearable tech will likely follow
						the same minimalist trend that followed when mobile phones
						first entered the market. As the popularity of such devices increases,
						the visibility of such devices decreases. In other words,
						visual elements change over time, making wearables look mundane
						or extravagant, like jewelry and clothing.
